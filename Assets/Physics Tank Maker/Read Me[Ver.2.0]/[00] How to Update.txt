*** How to update old tanks (from Ver.1.9 to Ver.2.0) ***

(1) Set up new options in the "Create_RoadWheel_CS(Script)".
    Select the "Create_RoadWheel(_##)".
    When the tank has Static Tracks, enable the "Fit for Static Tracks" option.
   

    And adjust the "Forward Limit Angle" and "Backward Limit Angle" values.
   
    [Forward Limit Angle]
    [Backward Limit Angle]
    The limit angle that the suspension arm can rotate forward or backward.
   


(2) Set the "Face the Enemy" option for AI tank if you need.
    The "Face the Enemy" option for AI tank has been moved from AI_Core to the top object of the tank.
    When the turret rotaion is limited in narrow angle range such as Jagdpanzer, set this option.
   
    [Face the Enemy]
    When this is checked, the AI tank will turn toward the target tank while attacking.

    [Face Offset Angle] (This option is displayed only when "Face the Enemy" is checked.)
    The offset angle toward the target tank while attacking.

    (Notice.)
    "Face the Enemy" option is set also from "Event_Controller".
    Please read the reference text "Event_Controller".


*** How to update old scene (from Ver.1.9 to Ver.2.0) ***

(1) Set up Event Cotrollers again.
    The function activating inactive events has been changed in Ver.2.0.
    When you need to inactive an event, disable its Event_Controller_CS(Script) instead of the GameObject.
    (Notice.)
    If the GameObject is inactivated, Game_Controller cannot correctly count the number of tanks in the scene.
